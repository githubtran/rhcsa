### Manage users and groups

-  ***Task 1 :***<br> 
	Create three users (Derek, Tom, and Kenny) that belong to the instructors group. Prevent Tom's user from accessing a shell, and make his account expire 10 day from now

-  ***Task 2 :***<br> 
	Add 3 new users alice, bob and charles. Create a marketing group and add these users to the group. Create a directory /marketing and change the owner to alice and group to marketing. Set permissions so that members of the marketing group can share documents in the directory but nobody else can see them. Give charles read-only permission. Create an empty file in the directory

-  ***Task 3 :***<br> 
	Create user300 with the default attributes in the useradd and login.defs files. Assign this user a password and show the line entries from all 4 authentication files

-  ***Task 4 :***<br>

-  ***Task 5 :***<br> 
	Configure password ageing for Derek using the chage command . Set the mindays to 7, maxdays to 28, and warndays to 5. Verify the new settings. Rerun the command and set account expiry to January 31, 2022

-  ***Task 6 :***<br> 
	Configure password aging for using the PASSWD command. Set the mindays to 10, maxdays to 90, and warndays to 14, and verify the new settings. Set the number of inactivity days to 5 and ensure that the user is forced to change their password upon next login

### Manage security

-  ***Task 1 :***<br> 
	Create a file acluser as user100 in /tmp and check if there are any ACL settings on the file. Apply access ACLs on the file for user100 for read and write access. Add user200 to the file for full permissions. Remove all access ACLs from the file

-  ***Task 2 :***<br> 
	Generate a password-less ssh key pair using RSA for user100 on server. Distribute the public key to client and attempt to log on to client from server. Show the log file message for the login attempt

-  ***Task 3 :***<br> 
	Remove the sshd service rule from the runtime configuration on server and try to access the server from the client using the ssh command

-  ***Task 4:***<br> 
	Create a directory sedir1 under /tmp and a file sefile1 under sedir1. Check the context on the directory and file. Change the SELinux user and type to user_u and public_content_t on both and verify 

-  ***Task 5 :***<br> 
	Add the current context on sedir1 to the SELinux policy database to ensure a relabeling will not reset it to its previous value. Next, you will change the context on the directory to some random values. Restore the default context from the policy database back to the directory recursively

	tip: chcon write the context to the file sys and not to the policy so everything is overwritten when 
		 the fs is relabeled where the original context is restored from the policy to the file sys 
		 so it's recommended to work with semanage 

-  ***Task 6 :***<br> 
	Add a non-standard port 8010 to the SELinux policy database for the httpd service and confirm the addition. Remove the port from the policy and verify the deletion

-  ***Task 7 :***<br> 
	Create a file called sefile2 under /tmp and display its context. Copy this file to the /etc/default directory, and observe the change in the context. Remove sefile2 from /etc/default, and copy it again to the same destination, ensuring that the target file receives the source file's context

-  ***Task 8 :***<br> 
	Display the current state of the Boolean nfs_export_all_rw. Toggle its value temporarily, and reboot the system. Flip its value persistently after the system has been back up 


### Manage containers 

-  ***Task 1 :***<br> 
	Download the Apache web server container image (httpd 2.4) and inspect the container image. Check the exposed ports in the container image configuration

	UBI images "stands for universal base image" and it is used as the foundation for all of the redhat product : registry.redhat.io/ubi8/httpd-24
	vim - : this is vim func that reads the STDIN 
	The puprose of skopeo: you can inspect the image without the need of pulling the image from the registry
-  ***Task 2 :***<br> 
	Run the httpd container in the background. Assign the name myweb to the container, verify that the container is running, stop the container and verify that it has stopped, and delete the container and the container image

-  ***Task 3 :***<br> 
	Pull the Apache web server container image (httpd 2.4) and run the container with the name webserver. Configure webserver to display content "Welcome to container-based web server". Use port 3333 on the host machine to receive http requests. Start a bash shell in the container to verify the configuration

-  ***Task 4 :***<br> 
	Configure the system to start the webserver container at boot as a systemd service. Start/enable the systemd service to make sure the container will start at boot, and reboot the system to verify if the container is running as expected

&nbsp;&nbsp;if you face this error: Failed to connect to bus [check this link](https://access.redhat.com/discussions/6029491) 

-  ***Task 5 :***<br> 
	Create a container logserver from an image rsyslog in server1 from registry.redhat.io<br>
	- Configure the container with systemd services by an existing user user10.<br>
	- Service name should be container-logserver, and configure it to start automatically across reboot.<br>
	- Configure your host journal to store all journal across reboot, copy all *.journal from /var/log/journal and all subdirectories to /home/user10/container_logserver <br>
	- Configure automount /var/log/journal from  logserver (container) to
/home/user10/container_logserver when container starts.
